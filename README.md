# üß† SynthStroke: SPM Toolbox for Stroke Lesion Segmentation

SynthStroke is a powerful toolbox for SPM (Statistical Parametric Mapping) that performs automated stroke lesion segmentation on brain MRI images using deep learning techniques.

## ‚ú® Features

- Automated stroke lesion segmentation
- Integration with SPM12
- Support for Test Time Augmentation (TTA)
- Binary hole filling for lesion masks
- Customizable output options

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Download the SynthStroke toolbox.
2. Place the SynthStroke folder in your SPM toolbox directory:
   ```
   /path/to/spm12/toolbox/SynthStroke
   ```
3. Restart SPM12 or refresh the SPM toolbox menu.

That's it! No additional compilation or external dependencies are required.

## üöÄ Usage

1. Open SPM12
2. Navigate to "Batch" ‚Üí "SPM" ‚Üí "Tools" ‚Üí "SynthStroke"
3. In the batch editor:
   - Select your input image(s)
   - Choose your desired options
   - Set the output directory (optional)
   - Run the batch

## ‚öôÔ∏è Options

- **Use TTA**: Enable Test Time Augmentation for potentially improved results
- **Fill holes**: Apply binary hole filling to the lesion mask
- **Lesion threshold**: Set the threshold for lesion classification (0-1)
- **Output prefix**: Customize the prefix for output files

## üìä Output

SynthStroke generates:
- Posterior probability maps for each class
- Binary lesion mask

## üìã Requirements

- MATLAB (R2022b or later recommended)
- SPM12
- Deep Learning Toolbox

**Important Note:** SynthStroke works out of the box with pure MATLAB. There is no need for Python, CUDA, or MEX compilation. This toolbox is designed to run seamlessly within the MATLAB environment, making it easy to use without additional setup or dependencies.
